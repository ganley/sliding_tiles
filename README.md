# sliding_tiles

Fun with sliding-tile puzzles. These are the kind with differently-sized
rectangular pieces, such as Quzzle and John Conway's Century, not the kind with
unit-sized pieces like the 15 puzzle or the many variations with images.

There's a simple web widget in `web`, and I'm working on a solver which
will eventually live in `solver`. Currently all that's in there is Gil
Dogon's 2005 obfuscated one, which is extremely obfuscated indeed.
